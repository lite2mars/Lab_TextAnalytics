Sky,"Reviewed in the United States on February 29, 2024","Was nervous purchasing a phone off Amazon but the seller (electronic deals) was really nice. So far so good and no issues with the phone. It did have a small deep scratch near the end of the screen which as stated in excellent condition it shouldn‚Äôt have but for the price and quality you can‚Äôt really beat it. It doesn‚Äôt affect the phone at all. The little pin that is used to take your your SIM card out was missing but it came with a charging cord and charging block. Came with 83 percent battery capacity, speakers work well and doesn‚Äôt seem to be any problems currently. Will update this review this after having the phone for a bit. Overall very happy with the seller and phone so far tho:D"
Aimee Roberts,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2024",I was honestly so nervous to buy this phone especially with all the mixed reviews I read on it. The box it came in was a little beat up it wasn‚Äôt a regular iPhone box just a brown box which is fine. But the phone itself is perfect. Mine didn‚Äôt have not one scratch and I closely examined it. No scuff marks no scratches on the camera PERFECT. Basically it‚Äôs like getting a brand new phone from the store. The sound quality is great very loud! I was able to pop my SIM card in transfer all my stuff no problems at all. The only thing is it came completely dead which was really not even an issue. My battery capacity is at 82%. I‚Äôve had no problems with the charging and it hold a charge very well. It‚Äôs been almost a week since getting it and everything is working great! So if your on a tight budget and want a VERY GOOD basically new iPhone I 100% recommend this one!
Anonymous561,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2024","My local electronics store sells the iPhone 12 Pro 512 gb for 600+ dollars while I got it for about 430 on here. It was a great deal for an excellent condition phone. I bought it from a seller named ‚Äúmax electronics‚Äù which didn‚Äôt have any reviews. I was very skeptical but I really needed a new phone, so I budged and I was pleasantly surprised. 1) it arrived quickly. 2) it looks almost brand new except for the battery of course (84% healthy) which was expected for a refurbished phone 3) it was nicely packaged in a plastic film and white box with new charger and chord. 4) the phone powered on immediately and was fully charged when arrived.I am unsure how to review this exact seller (max electronics) but my experience with the seller above has been great. I hope they get much more business!! If anything happens to the phone I will update. But I am happy with me ‚Äúnew‚Äù phone. I love it and the color. It‚Äôs pretty perfect."
Sunflower96,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2023",When I received the package the phone wasn‚Äôt packed in it‚Äôs original Apple boxing which would‚Äôve been nice since I‚Äôm gifting this IPhone 12 Pro to my boyfriend but I‚Äôm actually pretty happy with my order. I like how the phone came with a brand new installed glass protector that looks flawless and multiple SIM card tray keys which comes in handy. It‚Äôs expected for a refurbished product to have some flaws but this phone has extremely minor and very minuscule flaws such as some very almost unnoticeable scratches around the edges of the phone unless you really look and give close up and sharp eye examination but they‚Äôre so minor and the phone is going to have a case eventually anyway. I‚Äôm not going to hold the non Apple boxing against the seller and product because again this is a refurbished product and not brand new and I‚Äôm overall very happy with the quality of what I received and I did like the kind of box it came in. Along with the phone is a charging cord and wall adapter that‚Äôs not by Apple and is by a company called Ashley. I‚Äôm honestly not that worried about the off brand charger but it was thoughtful to provide. I did turn on the phone and everything worked and looked great but I didn‚Äôt test the sound. I‚Äôll update on the sound quality when my boyfriend opens it for Christmas.
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2024","The phone was in good condition with a flawless screen. However, there were scratches on the back and around the charging port. Although the battery was guaranteed to be at least 80% efficient, the phone would not power on unless it was constantly connected to a charger."
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2024",My first refurbished phone.  It was described as excellent condition.  It arrived on time and included the charger.  It appears to be flawless with battery at 100%.  I‚Äôve only had it two days but so far I‚Äôm very well pleased.
Estevan Anguiano,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2024","It was perfect and came on time, there wasn‚Äôt anything noticeable until further looking but you had to ‚Äúreally‚Äù look to see the problems. The screen has a light scuff on the black part of the phone next to the camera I couldn‚Äôt even tell until the sun was on the screen in an angle to notice it but everything else is perfect. Battery life came at 90%. I made a good investment thinking the negative comments would take a toll on the product but this wasn‚Äôt the caseüíØüôåüèº"
raniel saludo,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2023","I‚Äôll preface this review by saying I am pretty picky when it comes to my possessions.  My IPhone 7+ finally gave up the ghost.  I was hoping to get through the remainder of this year so that when the IPhone 15 came out that I would get a renewed 14 Max Pro but that was not to be.  We had purchased a renewed IPhone 12 for my son from another seller and were surprised with how clean it was when it arrived.  We paid extra for the excellent condition and it was in pristine condition with a 100% battery max battery health.Prime day comes along and I see this phone from this seller.  It was roughly $200 more than the regular IPhone 12 that we bought for my son but it was the Pro model and it did have 512k of storage.  Due to the positive experience we had with the earlier purchase, I decided to pull the trigger.Fulfillment was great.  I had ordered the phone on 7/11 and it was scheduled to arrive on 7/14 but to my surprise it hit my house on 7/13 which was a nice surprise.When I picked up the package I got worried because I could hear and feel something rattling in the box that was shipped in a form fitting padded envelope.  To my relief I found the phone  to be intact.  It arrived with protective plastic on the screen, a SIM port tool, and a lightning charging cable that was loose in the box.  Upon inspection I found the screen to be free of scratches or gouges but there is some slight surface marring on a small section of the screen that you have to look for in order to see.  The bezel was clean except for a couple of nicks.  The worst sign of usage is a chip above the top of the highest camera lens.  It‚Äôs not huge but you can definitely see it and it looks like a chip in a car windshield since the back of the phone is finished in glass.  The only other thing to mention is that there was a bit of what looks like green metal tape that was poking out of the side of the phone between the screen and bezel which I was able to rub off with my fingernail.  It looked like the refurb process was not as clean as it could have been.Going into the settings I found that the max battery life was only 85% which was kind of a bummer.  Setting up the phone was a breeze with ICloud but I haven‚Äôt figured out how to pull down the pictures that resided on my old phone.  My apps came over but know I had to re-enter my passwords in most cases.After only a couple of day usage, everything seems to work fine.  Amazon gives 90 days to return for any issues.  The camera on the pro is a definite improvement over the 7+.  Size wise the unit is smaller than the 7+ but the screen is bigger on the 12 since it doesn‚Äôt have the home button at the bottom which I keep wanting to press out of habit.Overall the purchase was better than ok.  If the phone has another 10% of battery life and the nick on the camera was not present then I would rate the item as excellent.  I‚Äôll always wonder if I should have purchased a phone from the other seller that sold a phone in perfect condition.  I will update this review should anything major happen with the phone."
